# Health EDA

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset. The goal is to understand the data, clean it, and derive insights that can help in predicting heart disease.

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Data Loading and Inspection

1. **Import necessary libraries**:

   - Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Load the dataset**:

   - The heart disease dataset is loaded using pandas.

3. **Inspect the dataset**:
   - Basic information about the dataset is displayed, including the first few rows and descriptive statistics.
   - **Thought Process**: This step helps in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying the types of variables, and getting an initial sense of the data distribution.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning

1. **Handle Misrepresented Data in columns**:

   - Check each column for misrepresented data and encode categorical columns if necessary.
   - **Thought Process**: Ensuring that each column contains the correct type of data is crucial for accurate analysis. Misrepresented data can lead to incorrect conclusions.

2. **Handle Missing Values**:

   - Count missing values in each column and decide on strategies for handling them.
   - **Thought Process**: Missing values can skew the analysis. Depending on the extent of missing data, strategies such as imputation or removal of rows/columns are considered.

3. **Handle Duplicates**:
   - Check for duplicates in the dataset.
   - **Thought Process**: Duplicates can distort the analysis by giving undue weight to certain observations. Removing duplicates ensures that each observation is unique.

### Task 3: Univariate Analysis

1. **Visualize distributions of numerical variables**:

   - Use histograms and boxplots to visualize the distributions.
   - **Thought Process**: Visualizing the distribution of numerical variables helps in understanding their spread, central tendency, and presence of outliers.

2. **Analyze categorical variables**:
   - Plot bar charts for categorical variables.
   - **Thought Process**: Bar charts provide a clear view of the frequency distribution of categorical variables, helping in identifying dominant categories.

### Task 4: Bivariate Analysis

1. **Numerical-Numerical Relationships**:

   - Create scatterplots to explore relationships and calculate the correlation matrix.
   - **Thought Process**: Scatterplots and correlation matrices help in identifying relationships between numerical variables, which can be crucial for predictive modeling.

2. **Categorical-Numerical Relationships**:

   - Compare target across independent variables using boxplots.
   - **Thought Process**: Boxplots allow for comparison of distributions across different categories, helping in identifying significant differences.

3. **Categorical-Categorical Relationships**:
   - Create a crosstab to explore categories.
   - **Thought Process**: Crosstabs help in understanding the relationship between two categorical variables, providing insights into their interaction.

### Task 5: Multivariate Analysis

- Use pairplots to visualize multiple relationships.
- **Thought Process**: Pairplots provide a comprehensive view of relationships between multiple variables, helping in identifying patterns and interactions.

### Task 6: Communication of Insights

1. **Summarize findings**:

   - Identify the most significant predictors of heart disease and notable patterns.
   - **Thought Process**: Summarizing findings helps in distilling the analysis into actionable insights. Key predictors and patterns are highlighted for further investigation or modeling.

2. **Create visualizations to support conclusions**:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook to present insights with visuals.
   - **Thought Process**: Visualizations make the findings more accessible and easier to understand, aiding in effective communication of insights.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the heart disease dataset, highlighting key predictors and patterns. The visualizations and insights derived can aid in better understanding and predicting heart disease.
